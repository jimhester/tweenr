#' @details
#' tweenr is a small collection of functions to help you in creating
#' intermediary representations of your data, i.e. interpolating states of data.
#' As such it's a great match for packages such as animate and gganimate, since
#' it can work directly with data.frames of data, but it also provide fast and
#' efficient interpolaters for numeric, date, datetime and colour that are
#' vectorized and thus more efficient to use than the build in interpolation
#' functions (mainly \code{\link[stats]{approx}} and
#' \code{\link[grDevices]{colorRamp}}).
#'
#' The main functions for data.frames are \code{\link{tween_states}},
#' \code{\link{tween_elements}} and \code{\link{tween_appear}}, while the
#' standard interpolaters can be found at \code{\link{tween}}
